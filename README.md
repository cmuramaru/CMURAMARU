I specialize in transforming complex datasets into clear, actionable insights that drive business decisions. With a strong foundation in analytical thinking and technical skills, I excel at building dashboards, performing in-depth data analysis, and developing data-driven strategies that improve efficiency and uncover growth opportunities.
 
ðŸ”­ Currently, I'm working on an efficiency project developing a data dashboard for a shoe company aimed to attract more customers and drive up sales. By trying different ways of modeling and many conference hours with my mentor, I am able to cross-track each metric and model the data more accurately. By learning advanced data visualization and sustainable tech solutions, I am able to design content thatâ€™s both insightful and impactful. Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on educational media, data-driven storytelling, and net-zero initiatives. I believe collaboration leads to stronger, more innovative results.

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with scaling digital content for broader audiences. Reaching more people means creating greater positive change.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about instructional design, simplifying complex topics, and creative project planning. I enjoy breaking down challenges into clear, practical steps.
